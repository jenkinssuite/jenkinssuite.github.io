When you access Jenkins, it is the same list as the list in View that you can see in the first Dashboard (main page). You can create/modify a View or view or change its settings.

### Config View

> If you press the right mouse button in an existing *All* View or a newly created View, you can view the settings of the View.

* You can easily modify the order of columns and includeRegex.
* After modifying the Jenkins configuration file (XML Data), you can click Execute View (Ctrl+K, F3) to reflect the settings.
